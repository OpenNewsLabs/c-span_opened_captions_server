 president obama: recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. they understood our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it in title us to do as we please. instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use. our security emanates from the justice of our cause. the force of our example. the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. we are the keepers of this legacy. guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, greater cooperation and understanding between nations. we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and fort a hard-earned peace in afghanistan. with old friends and former foes we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet. we will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in his defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger. we will defeat you. >> [applause] president obama: for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. we are a nations of christians and muslims, jews and hindus, and nonbelievers. we are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve, that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. to the muslim world, we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect. for those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the west, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. to those -- to those who claim power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history. that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. >> [applause] president obama: so the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let the waters flow. to nourish our bodies and feed hungry minds. to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders. nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to affect. the world has changed and we must change with it. as we consider the world that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. a have something to tell us. the fallen heroes at arlington whisper through the ages. we honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service. a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. and yet, at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. for as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies. it is the kindness to taking a stranger when the levees break. the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours and see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. it is the firefighters courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parents willingness to nurture a child that finally decide our fate. our challenges may be new, the instruments with which we meet them maybe new but those values upon which our success depends, honesty, and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism, these things are old. these things are true. they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. what has demanded is a return to these truths. what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility. a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world. duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying of the spirit, so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task. this is the price and the promise of citizenship. this is the source of our confidence. the knowledge that god called on us to shape an uncertain destiny. this is the meaning of our liberty and our free while men and women of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father left him 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath. >> [applause] president obama: let us mark today with remembrance. of who we are and how far we have traveled. in the year of america's birth, on the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by a dying campfire on the shore of an icy river. capital was abandoned, the enemy was advancing, the snow was veined with blood. and the moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people. "let it be told to the future world that in the depths of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet it. america, in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words." "let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come." let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter. and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god's grace upon us, we carry forth that great gift of freedom and deliver to future generations. thank you. god bless you. god bless the united states of america. >> [applause] >> today is martin luther king day, a federal holiday. we are live at his memorial in washington. there was a visit earlier by vice president-elect mike and and south carolina republican senator tim scott. let's take in the scene for a moment.
