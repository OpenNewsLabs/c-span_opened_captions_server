 president obama: recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. they understood our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it in title us to do as we please. instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use. our security emanates from the justice of our cause. the force of our example. the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. we are the keepers of this legacy. guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, greater cooperation and understanding between nations. we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and fort a hard-earned peace in afghanistan. with old friends and former foes we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet. we will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in his defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger. we will defeat you. >> [applause] president obama: for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. we are a nations of christians and muslims, jews and hindus, and nonbelievers. we are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve, that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. to the muslim world, we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect. for those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the west, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. to those -- to those who claim power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history. that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. >> [applause] president obama: so the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let the waters flow. to nourish our bodies and feed hungry minds. to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders. nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to affect. the world has changed and we must change with it. as we consider the world that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. a have something to tell us. the fallen heroes at arlington whisper through the ages. we honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service. a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. and yet, at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. for as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies. it is the kindness to taking a stranger when the levees break. the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours and see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. it is the firefighters courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parents willingness to nurture a child that finally decide our fate. our challenges may be new, the instruments with which we meet them maybe new but those values upon which our success depends, honesty, and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism, these things are old. these things are true. they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. what has demanded is a return to these truths. what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility. a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world. duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying of the spirit, so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task. this is the price and the promise of citizenship. this is the source of our confidence. the knowledge that god called on us to shape an uncertain destiny. this is the meaning of our liberty and our free while men and women of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father left him 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath. >> [applause] president obama: let us mark today with remembrance. of who we are and how far we have traveled. in the year of america's birth, on the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by a dying campfire on the shore of an icy river. capital was abandoned, the enemy was advancing, the snow was veined with blood. and the moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people. "let it be told to the future world that in the depths of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet it. america, in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words." "let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come." let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter. and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god's grace upon us, we carry forth that great gift of freedom and deliver to future generations. thank you. god bless you. god bless the united states of america. >> [applause] >> today is martin luther king day, a federal holiday. we are live at his memorial in washington. there was a visit earlier by vice president-elect mike and and south carolina republican senator tim scott. let's take in the scene for a moment. [no audio] >> our cameras here live at the mlk memorial in washington. we will be checking back in throughout the day. president-elect trump is marking the holiday. the hill tweets out that he will

martin luther king the third expected to meet with the president-elect. >> continuing to monitor the scene in manhattan, we will bring you updates as warranted. we are featuring several political and public affairs radio show simulcast. we kick things off with the larry o'connor show here in washington. that is live today starting at 3:00 p.m. on c-span. we've got more early wednesday with redeye

dc. the focus was voting rights, criminal justice and pay equity. following the march a rally was held new the martin luther king jr. memorial. speakers include president cornell william brooks, author and professor michael eric dyson, u.s. jeff merkley and washington dc mayor bowser. this is one hour and 15 minutes. >> good morning, all. i am ariel bowser and i am the mayor of the best city in the world and i want to welcome the national action network to washington, d.c. i want to welcome you all to my hometown in your nation's capital and i want to thank and recognize our reverend al for his leadership, our reverend al for his vision and our reverend al for standing up for all of us . over the last several months, we have been reminded of the values we have to fight for. we have been reminded of reverend dr. martin luther king and what he stood for. how he told us that we had to look beyond ourselves, look beyond our own generation and make sure this was an america that was worthy of us all. i am reminded in my own hometown that we have to fight on a local level, a state level and a federal level and that is why we are truly blessed that reverend al has called us together. it is not where we start but where we are growing and i am proud that in washington, d.c. the nation will look to us. in our city, we know that we can't rely on the federal government and we don't have a state government. we are the city, county, and the state all in one. and because of that, we have fought to get our crime rate down, unemployment down, graduations up and more people getting a second chance in our cities. we have assisted to make d.c. one of the most inclusive places anywhere in these united states. we are committed to justice and equity and committed to making american values all peoples values and that is our focus. as mayor of washington, d.c. we know that we can be at the forefront to fight for criminal justice reforms that make our city and our nation more fair. we have led the way in working with our brothers and sisters in labor to pass a minimum wage of $15 by 2020 and we call him the nation to do the same. we know that we can't have a prosperous city that we are proud of if more washingtonians don't participate in it and that is why we are more committed to affordable housing than ever. we know that we have to stand up for the human rights of women, of girls, of our lgbt community, of latinos, of african-americans, and anybody that would be frightened or scared in their nation. we are asking you to stand up for us. you know that we live in the shadow of the nation's capital that we don't have a vote in that capital. in d.c. we demand statehood because that is the only way we can truly be equal. i hope that while you are in washington, i know you're going to see our fantastic memorial to the reverend dr. martin luther king and you will remember when he was at spelman college, he said five decades ago "if you can't fly then you should run, if you can't walk then you should crawl, but by all means, keep moving." keep moving, national action network and washington dc is right here with you. god bless you all. >> and now for our invocation, he is the senior pastor of the historic baptist church in brooklyn where reverend dr. william augustus jones baptized reverend sharpton. it is reverend sharpton's home church and we are grateful to have with us reverend -- >> let us center ourselves. eternal god, grand architect of this universe, we thank you for this day, we thank you for this beautiful day because any day above ground is a beautiful day. a day to resolve our determination to stand for justice as we stand in the shadow of one of your saints, dr. king, we thank you for his legacy that continues through the national action network and the reverend al sharpton. we pray for all of those that have gathered across this country as we unite together to stand for justice, equality, freedom, be with us in this encounter. in your name we pray, amen. now, my colleagues, let us received at this time my colleague the west coast regional director of the national action network, reverend dr. k w two loaves. -- >> no justice. no justice. no justice. brothers and sisters, it is a beautiful day. as i look amongst you, one of the things i recognized is god is alive and well. how do i know? i spoke to him earlier this morning and he assured me that everything is going to be all right. i don't know about you today, but today, we have come to send a strong message to this nation. we shall overcome. we shall not be moved. we have come this morning from the west coast, from the east coast, from the north, from the south, to send a strong message, to make some noise and to let this world know that we will not out down. we will take a stand. we will march. we will raise our voices like a triumph. i don't know about you but i am excited because as i look among these beautiful people, as i look amongst you, i see the audacity of hope. i see individuals in the street. i see individuals that are ready to raise their voice. i don't know about you today, but like the three hebrew boys, we are not going to bow down. we are going to move with the finger of god. we are going to let them know that we are going to speak truth to power. we have seen what this world is coming to. 14 days into a brand-new year, we want to send a message that shows that you are appointing to these national positions, that they will hear from us. we know that the sad thing is he doesn't sound good. are you ready to fight? are you ready to win? make some noise. make some noise. keep it alive. >> [applause] >> my brother and colleague, the midwest regional director of the national action that work and the senior pastor of king solomon baptist church in detroit, michigan, let's receive reverend dr. charles williams junior. >> what time is it? it is fighting time. let me hear you. what time is it? what time is it? no justice -- what do we want? when do we want it? let me hear you make some noise. we stand here in the shadow of the washington monument. we stand here in the shadow of dr. martin luther king junior's monument. but we don't stand here because we just deserve it. somebody had to pay a price and the question is, is that we have the opportunity to stand here now. but are we willing to stand up and fight back so that those who come after us get the opportunity to stand here too? the question is, are we really just fighting to make sure that we hold on to health care? are we willing to fight to make sure that every man and woman has the opportunity and access to jobs? are we willing to stand and fight the racist police that continue to reign terror on our boys in cities across america? if we fight, we win. when we don't, we won't. and so although we are happy to be in this space today, the real fight is the fight that we must fight when we go back home. whether it is in detroit, michigan, whether it is in pennsylvania, philadelphia, whether it is in washington, d.c., whether it is in new york, they are fighting. if we fight, we win. no justice -- >> no peace. >> one of the reasons i have a lot of faith in our future is because our future is in the hands of people like my sister, my young sister, a student at spelman college and carrying the banner all throughout atlanta and georgia. she is our national youth director of the national action network and carries that message across the nation. she is a millennial leader in her own right. let us perceive right now, my sister. mary hector. >> i think it is important that before i start, i acknowledge the fact that millennials organized this march. with the assistance of reverend sharpton, millennials organized this march and they deserve that acknowledgment. i will name a few. millennials like kylie mcmillan, ashley sharpton, emily riley, i know i am forgetting some. i could go on and on about the millennials all across the country that helped put this together and the ones standing behind me. and so, please give these young people a round of applause. as we stand here, i can't help but think about the woman who at this very second is being sexually assaulted and may have to face her rapist every day because there are people advocating to end safe abortions in our country. i couldn't help but think about the african-american teenager today that lost their lives due to gun violence. i pray for the health of my loved ones who will no longer have health care because they are trying to repeal the affordable health care act. while these issues may seem different to you, the truth is that cannot be any further from the truth. dr. king had a dream that we could all stand together in unity and work together. but all i have seen in the news in the media is divisiveness.
