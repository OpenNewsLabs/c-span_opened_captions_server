[applause] >> it is appropriate that we would be here on dr. king's birthday. we often ask ourselves but what would martin luther king do? our movement didn't tend because people were tired. our movement continued. the only thing that stopped dr. king is what the fbi did. the same thing they are doing today. we must oppose the attorney general jeff sessions. we must stand up for our rights and we must do exactly as dr. king would have us do on his birthday. we have several other distinguished speakers to bring forward to you. first and foremost, please welcome a very active brother. you see him often representing the people of new york from the city council. and this is important because we need to allstate -- all start thinking about running for office ourselves. this brother sets the example. you make a difference on city council. you make a difference in local elected office. in this brother certainly is making a difference. please welcome the councilmember from brooklyn. [indiscernible] >> how are you doing from brooklyn? good to see you all out here. if you can't stand a little cold and rain, you might not make it the next few years. the last two years, people were asleep. everybody is woke now. don't be afraid. you got to come anyway. there is a book that i read to help us get through it. but joy, not just a smile. joy, not just happy. joy is coming in the morning. but it didn't say it would come easy. it didn't say it would come without a fight. and that means you have to be the light. we have to be in the dark a start to see the brightest star. tell them i will be your star. i will be your light. you be my star. you be my light. we will get it together. we will fight just a hold on for a little while longer. the joy will come. they never said it would be easy. hold on, because i know from where i speak. i am the descendent of a slave that just wanted to hold on to get us here. look back and say, thank god, i understood. we are just in an arc. it is not a. . you have done hold on to keep moving forward. no justice, no peace. isn't just a mantra. it is a moral edict. people ask her one and not the other. from sea to shining sea, hold on. it does, listen closely. your children's children are saying please, don't forget about us. hold on because we have the answer back. that we won't let you down. we will bring the torch to you. it might not be pretty. just hold on and keep fighting. hold on. hold on. keep fighting. we have to fight. >> give councilmember williams another round of applause. we know there is a war against organized labor. we have reason to believe this new president is going to continue that war. we have to stand up against it. welcome a young brother who's trying to be part of the union. we shouldn't take anybody for granted. dr. king gave his life for garbage workers. people that, to a lot of us, don't even matter. how many of us speak to sanitation workers? that he sacrificed his life for sanitation workers. when we leave to go to the airport, this is a brother working on behalf of us and ought to be treated fairly. he's a baggage handler at ronald reagan international airport. i don't even like the name of that airport. never should've named that airport that airport. is sciu here? doesn't sound like it. welcome trey. >> good afternoon, my beautiful brothers and sisters. i'm from ronald reagan national airport. on the bag runner and supervisor. the wear and tear on my body is very significant. i'm not just trying to improve my life, but the lives of millions of workers. can you hear me? that afternoon, my beautiful brothers and sisters. i'm a baggage runner and supervisor at ronald reagan international airport. i represent 100 people that work like myself, two or three jobs every day that don't have time to go home. they sleep in their car or sleep at the airport. some people are getting paid $5.25 an hour. i been at the airport for nine years and i never got a raise. it's only $8.25 an hour. that's not enough. we're not making nothing. no raise, no health care, no benefits. no nothing. now trump coming is in the white house and trying to take away obama care. i refuse to believe that we will give up. we will fight and to we keep obama care. under the trump administration, we are facing the darkest days. it is the anti-worker. the regulations and the companies -- [indiscernible] it's like the fox guarding the hen house. he makes more in a day than i do in a year. i don't know how it is possible to understand my struggles. that is why we are committed to work together to do whatever it takes to get a minimum $15 in the union. after we have more power in that fight, it becomes a national action network. they fight for $15 and a union. i know dr. martin luther king will be fighting for dignity and respect. they will hold us back in the world and we already have too many things holding us down. we stay strong and united. we get this respect we reserve. we fight, we win. we fight, we win. god bless america. thank you. >> give him around of applause. we are in solidarity with all of our diverse communities. and we can proudly say, finally, that marriage equality exists in america. that's what dr. kring -- dr. king would of done. it's what loretto scott king would have done. representing the human rights campaign. the reverend dr. macarthur. give him a round of applause. >> on january 14, people in the rain. it was cold and it was freezing. some of us were shivering but we understood there were something we had to do that was bigger than us. i understand many of you stand with the lgbt community. but i come to make a statement this afternoon that the lgbt community stands with you. let me put it another way. as the father of five and the grandfather of the most beautiful baby boy that walked the face of this planet. i stand with you today because i understand it's not just about us. it's about voting rights. it's about health care. it's about jobs. it's about the ability to worship in the way that we choose to worship. what i'm here to declare is that we are for justice for all. some of us are depending on us to take a step back. they want to separate us on what some of us believe. but we are not following for that trick -- falling for that trick anymore. we shall not be moved. black folks, white folks, latino folks, lesbian folks, straight folks, muslim, jewish, left, right. we shall not be moved. we are not threatened by our diversity but as the greatest first lady that ever lived, michelle obama, has said. it is our diverse city that makes us who we are. we have some difficult days ahead. but i declare before you, standing with me on 1.5 million members of the human rights campaign, that we stand together. we stand united to get it right. old people, young people, women, men, transgender, black, white. we shall not be moved. let's hear it for the human rights campaign. in spite of -- the

that are prepared to roll up their sleeves and fight. we will take this fight to court across our nation. we will do the hard work necessary to make sure this administration enforces our nation's federal civil rights laws and is not turn this nation back. karen a scott king opposed the nomination of mr. jeff sessions to become a federal judge in 1986. misses king said that jeff sessions abused the awesome powers of his office in an attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters. we will not forget history. we will lift up the words and legacy of misses scott king and stand in

[applause] >> happy king day. happy king day. there we go. now then, reverend sharpton, distinct guests and the honored friends with us. one of my favorite quotes is life's most persistent and pressing question is what are you doing for others? he was asking this many times of people who have very little, if anything. i have a lot of friends in this room. many of you know my story. many of you know because i told you about how my mom, i grew up in a small eastern washington town. my mom was a domestic part-time bus driver. dad was a construction worker. on-again off-again unemployed. the first member of my family to go off to school. deal the reason i was able to go to school is one of the white women my mom kept house for. this white woman heard my mom one day praying. debbie allen. she said, please, ma'am. she said, a lease -- elise, if it is at all possible and your son truly wants to go to school, my husband fred and i have decided that we will pay his way. and because of that, i was able to go to college. but as paul hervey used to say, the rest of the story, what are you doing for others? he would do this for people that had nothing. getting ready to go to college, senator booker. getting ready to leave from that church. those people came out there that had nothing. mr. dylan brought me a pot of greens. sister osborne had a peach i -- peach pie. tonya had a pound cake. she only gave me half a pound cake if i put it together. when mom got ready to give me all of the money because dad told her to, she realized she couldn't do it because she had another child at home. i had to take what she gave me and go with that. but i went off to college and everything worked t fine. today, as you get ready to go out, make sure you understand that if dr. king was here, you would want you to know it's not a day off. it's a day on. go out and do something to make this world a better place. pastor marquez ball will get us off and running. let us pray. we call upon you, lord god, because through the years, you have been sustaining oppressed people. elijah was tired and worn. you blessed him with it. not only that, you blessed grandma with the leftovers. lord god, we are praying now that you can bless the food we are able to have at the mayflower hotel because there are those that came before us who march to give us an opportunity to have this breakfast. the journey before us is long. and we need to be sustained. we are praying that as we are sharing on this day, honoring one of our long-lasting servants. we play -- pray that you will bless the food. that it will sustain us and encourage us to see what it's going to be. we love you, we praise you, and we thank you. in jesus name, amen. it gives me great privilege now to introduce a man that has picked up the mantle of civil rights in so many ways. he has opened up the doors for leadership in women in his organization when it was not cool to do so. he has made it possible, and you see these young people doing every manner of operation inside that organization. a man constantly on the run. the energizer bunny. he speaks truth to power. the loft and those that can't speak for themselves. he is being used as a stage where others can shine. a man who i can honestly tell you tripped me out when i first went to new york and met him. it is a place called a house of justice. he was there. ladies and gentlemen, anyone who can create a house of justice, we need to hear from them. and we will do just that. they brought all of us together with this idea. the reverend out sharpton. al sharpton: let me first wish everyone a happy king day. the fight to make a national holiday. the struggle for civil rights, take this day more seriously than those that just take a three day weekend. because dr. king represents the struggle for human rights and civil rights. and even this holiday is a result of a civil rights effort led by his wife, miss karen escott king if you look at the area -- if you look at everyone, they celebrated that last year. her last five healthy years would come every year. today, her son is among those in the president-elect. with donald trump, many of us marched on saturday kicking off king weekend. thousands of us despite the icy rain and despite the fact that there were all kinds of predictions about even worse weather. i thought about how ronald reagan once called martin luther king a communist. ronald reagan ended up having to sign to make today a federal holiday. the same ronald reagan that denounced dr. king is the same president that signed to make today a federal holiday. president-elect trump, in the spirit of ronald reagan, ought to call john lewis. [applause] he ought to deal with the issues of today. he ought to, on king day, be king like. don't act like on the national chess, don't behave like a pond if you've been made a king. it's time for us to get bigger. and that's what dr. king did. i hope he reaches out to john lewis. i hope that he and senator booker at some point with the congressional black caucus. to really deal with the issues that we marched about. voting rights, health care, and police reform, as well as jobs. we need serious discussion about serious achievement that need to be done in this society. we honor people his new york chapter of operation, that we honor on king day. on a holiday that we have to fight. and let me preface this by acknowledging them that come up that movement. where is mellon? and a member of our board. and he also passed senator cory booker that details even if he's not in his seat. tonya lombard. our first award today goes to a man that i feel has symbolized the first century politics. politics in this century is defined differently. but at the same time, it continues in the same boundaries. there are those that try to act like reaching people on a grassroots level is something new. politics has always been about the bottom-up rather than the top down. whether you are an elitist sitting in some ivy league school analyzing from an ivory tower. whether you're on social media talking to folks that already like you. you must break outside of your boundaries. and move the nation forward. this person has personified that as far as i've known them. he became involved on the ground. and was elected the mayor of north new jersey. he stayed on the ground for the state of new jersey. he has not been afraid to take positions that he knew would get him attacked from the right and the left. that is why he is so representative of the spirit of dr. king, and people that have reached levels to approach greatness. dr. king said, you measure a man or woman not by where they stand at the time of convenience, but where they stand at the time of controversy. if every decision you make is easy, it means you are just an easy person. real leaders face hard consequences. it is understood and took a seat to testify against a fellow senator for the office of attorney general. we work together and agree on something. but i am too principled cannot stand and say the definition of what the office he is being nominated for this not fit some of the positions he's taken. or that the war in vietnam is wrong. it is the spirit of dr. king and we give our first award from the national action network to the senator from new jersey, senator cory booker. [applause] cory always reminds me and how i say that john lewis and jesse in them are a generation ahead of me and i'm a generation ahead of his. i will jump down to show him i'm not that old. [laughter] [applause] senator booker: the reverend and i have known each other for a very long time. politics in the black community, you agree with someone one day and against someone the other day but you always know your brothers in the cause. i think most of my elections, and has been with me. he has always treated me with respect, dignity, and courtesy. he is slightly an elder. not that much. he has modeled, for me, what grace and being a gentleman is. for that and many other things, i am deeply appreciative. the fact that this is 25, now 26 years of the national action network. we are action. now more than ever, people have to remember what king talked about. one to work for it and struggle for it. it is not the vigil at words and -- vitriolic words and actions of bad people, but we know the words of frederick douglass. it wasn't until i prayed with my hands and my feet that i found the freedom. it is simply hoping something would happen. they put forward a monumental effort. it did not affect them personally. that is the thing we have to understand. the worst kind of privilege is the privilege that says there are serious problems out there, but they don't affect me. so they don't demand my engagement. i know that i/o a lot to my community. the last 20 years, i have lived in newark, new jersey's central ward. i have lived on martin luther king boulevard or 100 yards from it. i got my ba from stanford but my phd on the streets of newark. i will tell you right now, some of my greatest professors of my life i found in martin luther king boulevard. it is an incredible street. it has great colleges and universities. there was violence and drug dealing and challenges. in the project that i eventually lived in for eight years, they stood me up and said, what do you see around you? the problems with the street and she said, you can never help me. i remember running after this elderly woman and grabbing her from behind -- very respectfully, mind you. the world you see is a reflection of what you have inside of you. if you only see problems, that's all it will ever be. but if every time you open your eyes, you see hope, you see the face of god, and you can be one of those people that helped me. i was still a lawsuit. working with great leaders like virginia jones. nothing are done in my life has set aside me more -- satisfied me more than taking on the bad actors in that community. when i moved into those buildings, the lessons i learned more often came from my brokenness then my successes. it came from my failures. that's what i want to share with you today. understanding that we come from a broken reality. do we sit here today and comfort, somebody is perhaps serving the food today that works a full-time job and still lives at or below the poverty line. understanding that we live in this broken reality is knowing that we sit here today knowing that children that are homeless, 14% are gay and lesbian teens because they are still facing outrageous hatred and bigotry. we have such violence against gay and lesbians. we live in a broken community that instead of dealing with issues of mental health, instead, we stigmatize it and take an inordinate amount in our jails and prisons. we stand here today in a time of brokenness. the environmental toxins in which kids live in. i was living in these buildings, chasing after the big goal and the big dream. activism just doesn't happen during presidential campaigns. it has to be an everyday choice that you make. i would come home at night. i lived on the 16th floor. i tell you, one of them was my dad. raised by his grandmother for a time and born poor. my friend hassan washington. these kids, i watch them grow up. i watch the election in 2002. and now the weight of 2006, i saw signs. one day i came home and felt something i hadn't felt so pungent since i was at stanford university. i smelt the marijuana. but we live in a nation with two different justice systems. a bunch of guys smoking pot at stanford get a very different treatment from the law as people smoking pot in the inner-city. we know there is no difference in drug use between blacks or whites. but if you're black, you will be arrested for it about 3.7 times more likely to be arrested. and the kid that is arrested in places like i grew up or places like stanford, they will get out of jail. it treats you so much better if you are rich and guilty then poor and innocent.
