 president obama: recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. they understood our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it in title us to do as we please. instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use. our security emanates from the justice of our cause. the force of our example. the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. we are the keepers of this legacy. guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, greater cooperation and understanding between nations. we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and fort a hard-earned peace in afghanistan. with old friends and former foes we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet. we will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in his defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger. we will defeat you. >> [applause] president obama: for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. we are a nations of christians and muslims, jews and hindus, and nonbelievers. we are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve, that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. to the muslim world, we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect. for those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the west, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. to those -- to those who claim power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history. that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. >> [applause] president obama: so the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let the waters flow. to nourish our bodies and feed hungry minds. to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders. nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to affect. the world has changed and we must change with it. as we consider the world that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. a have something to tell us. the fallen heroes at arlington whisper through the ages. we honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service. a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. and yet, at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. for as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies. it is the kindness to taking a stranger when the levees break. the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours and see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. it is the firefighters courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parents willingness to nurture a child that finally decide our fate. our challenges may be new, the instruments with which we meet them maybe new but those values upon which our success depends, honesty, and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism, these things are old. these things are true. they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. what has demanded is a return to these truths. what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility. a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world. duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying of the spirit, so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task. this is the price and the promise of citizenship. this is the source of our confidence. the knowledge that god called on us to shape an uncertain destiny. this is the meaning of our liberty and our free while men and women of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father left him 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath. >> [applause] president obama: let us mark today with remembrance. of who we are and how far we have traveled. in the year of america's birth, on the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by a dying campfire on the shore of an icy river. capital was abandoned, the enemy was advancing, the snow was veined with blood. and the moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people. "let it be told to the future world that in the depths of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet it. america, in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words." "let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come." let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter. and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god's grace upon us, we carry forth that great gift of freedom and deliver to future generations. thank you. god bless you. god bless the united states of america. >> [applause] >> today is martin luther king day, a federal holiday. we are live at his memorial in washington. there was a visit earlier by vice president-elect mike and and south carolina republican senator tim scott. let's take in the scene for a moment. [no audio] >> our cameras here live at the mlk memorial in washington. we will be checking back in throughout the day. president-elect trump is marking the holiday. the hill tweets out that he will meet with martin luther king's son to discuss the civil rights leaders legacy. read more about this at the hill.com. this is a live picture from the lobby of trump tower in new york city. we mentioned martin luther king the third expected to meet with the president-elect. >> continuing to monitor the scene in manhattan, we will bring you updates as warranted. we are featuring several political and public affairs radio show simulcast. we kick things off with the larry o'connor show here in washington. that is live today starting at 3:00 p.m. on c-span. we've got more early wednesday with redeye

television companies and is brought to you today by your cable or satellite provider. >> next, from saturday, reverend al sharpton and other civil rights leaders participate in a watch in washington dc. the focus was voting rights, criminal justice and pay equity. following the march a rally was held new the martin luther king jr. memorial. speakers include president cornell william brooks, author and professor michael eric dyson, u.s. jeff merkley and washington dc mayor bowser. this is one hour and 15 minutes. >> good morning, all. i am ariel bowser and i am the mayor of the best city in the world and i want to welcome the national action network to washington, d.c. i want to welcome you all to my hometown in your nation's capital and i want to thank and recognize our reverend al for his leadership, our reverend al for his vision and our reverend al for standing up for all of us . over the last several months, we have been reminded of the values we have to fight for. we have been reminded of reverend dr. martin luther king and what he stood for. how he told us that we had to look beyond ourselves, look beyond our own generation and make sure this was an america that was worthy of us all. i am reminded in my own hometown that we have to fight on a local level, a state level and a federal level and that is why we are truly blessed that reverend al has called us together. it is not where we start but where we are growing and i am proud that in washington, d.c. the nation will look to us. in our city, we know that we can't rely on the federal government and we don't have a state government. we are the city, county, and the state all in one. and because of that, we have fought to get our crime rate down, unemployment down, graduations up and more people getting a second chance in our cities. we have assisted to make d.c. one of the most inclusive places anywhere in these united states. we are committed to justice and equity and committed to making american values all peoples values and that is our focus. as mayor of washington, d.c. we know that we can be at the forefront to fight for criminal justice reforms that make our city and our nation more fair. we have led the way in working with our brothers and sisters in labor to pass a minimum wage of $15 by 2020 and we call him the nation to do the same. we know that we can't have a prosperous city that we are proud of if more washingtonians don't participate in it and that is why we are more committed to affordable housing than ever. we know that we have to stand up for the human rights of women, of girls, of our lgbt community, of latinos, of african-americans, and anybody that would be frightened or scared in their nation. we are asking you to stand up for us. you know that we live in the shadow of the nation's capital that we don't have a vote in that capital. in d.c. we demand statehood because that is the only way we can truly be equal. i hope that while you are in washington, i know you're going to see our fantastic memorial to the reverend dr. martin luther king and you will remember when he was at spelman college, he said five decades ago "if you can't fly then you should run, if you can't walk then you should crawl, but by all means, keep moving." keep moving, national action network and washington dc is right here with you. god bless you all. >> and now for our invocation, he is the senior pastor of the historic baptist church in brooklyn where reverend dr. william augustus jones baptized reverend sharpton. it is reverend sharpton's home church and we are grateful to have with us reverend -- >> let us center ourselves. eternal god, grand architect of this universe, we thank you for this day, we thank you for this beautiful day because any day above ground is a beautiful day. a day to resolve our determination to stand for justice as we stand in the shadow of one of your saints, dr. king, we thank you for his legacy that continues through the national action network and the reverend al sharpton. we pray for all of those that have gathered across this country as we unite together to stand for justice, equality, freedom, be with us in this encounter. in your name we pray, amen. now, my colleagues, let us received at this time my colleague the west coast regional director of the national action network, reverend dr. k w two loaves. -- >> no justice. no justice. no justice. brothers and sisters, it is a beautiful day. as i look amongst you, one of the things i recognized is god is alive and well. how do i know? i spoke to him earlier this morning and he assured me that everything is going to be all right. i don't know about you today, but today, we have come to send a strong message to this nation. we shall overcome. we shall not be moved. we have come this morning from the west coast, from the east coast, from the north, from the south, to send a strong message, to make some noise and to let this world know that we will not out down. we will take a stand. we will march. we will raise our voices like a triumph. i don't know about you but i am excited because as i look among these beautiful people, as i look amongst you, i see the audacity of hope. i see individuals in the street. i see individuals that are ready to raise their voice. i don't know about you today, but like the three hebrew boys, we are not going to bow down. we are going to move with the finger of god. we are going to let them know that we are going to speak truth to power. we have seen what this world is coming to. 14 days into a brand-new year, we want to send a message that shows that you are appointing to these national positions, that they will hear from us. we know that the sad thing is he doesn't sound good. are you ready to fight? are you ready to win? make some noise. make some noise. keep it alive. >> [applause] >> my brother and colleague, the midwest regional director of the national action that work and the senior pastor of king solomon baptist church in detroit, michigan, let's receive reverend dr. charles williams junior. >> what time is it? it is fighting time. let me hear you. what time is it? what time is it? no justice -- what do we want? when do we want it? let me hear you make some noise. we stand here in the shadow of the washington monument. we stand here in the shadow of dr. martin luther king junior's monument. but we don't stand here because we just deserve it. somebody had to pay a price and the question is, is that we have the opportunity to stand here now. but are we willing to stand up and fight back so that those who come after us get the opportunity to stand here too? the question is, are we really just fighting to make sure that we hold on to health care? are we willing to fight to make sure that every man and woman has the opportunity and access to jobs? are we willing to stand and fight the racist police that continue to reign terror on our boys in cities across america? if we fight, we win. when we don't, we won't. and so although we are happy to be in this space today, the real fight is the fight that we must fight when we go back home. whether it is in detroit, michigan, whether it is in pennsylvania, philadelphia, whether it is in washington, d.c., whether it is in new york, they are fighting. if we fight, we win. no justice -- >> no peace. >> one of the reasons i have a lot of faith in our future is because our future is in the hands of people like my sister, my young sister, a student at spelman college and carrying the banner all throughout atlanta and georgia. she is our national youth director of the national action network and carries that message across the nation. she is a millennial leader in her own right. let us perceive right now, my sister. mary hector. >> i think it is important that before i start, i acknowledge the fact that millennials organized this march. with the assistance of reverend sharpton, millennials organized this march and they deserve that acknowledgment. i will name a few. millennials like kylie mcmillan, ashley sharpton, emily riley, i know i am forgetting some. i could go on and on about the millennials all across the country that helped put this together and the ones standing behind me. and so, please give these young people a round of applause. as we stand here, i can't help but think about the woman who at this very second is being sexually assaulted and may have to face her rapist every day because there are people advocating to end safe abortions in our country. i couldn't help but think about the african-american teenager today that lost their lives due to gun violence. i pray for the health of my loved ones who will no longer have health care because they are trying to repeal the affordable health care act. while these issues may seem different to you, the truth is that cannot be any further from the truth. dr. king had a dream that we could all stand together in unity and work together. but all i have seen in the news in the media is divisiveness. in order for us to move forward, there needs to be unity. there is a war on women in this country, there is a war on black and brown bodies in this country, there is a war on justice in this country. and so today, we stand here in washington, d.c. to tell donald trump, jeff sessions, and everybody else in his administration that we will not be moved. that millennials -- that adults -- that indigenous people -- that immigrants are working together in unity, pushing the message of a second wave of the civil rights movement. in the spirit of dr. martin luther king and the spirit of ida b wells and the spirit of shirley chisholm and so many great people. and so, today, we need to understand that it is not just donald trump that we have to worry about. because all politics are local. and so you have to find it within yourself after today to go back home and to keep up the fight for four years. for four years. it is our duty to fight for our freedom. it is our duty to win. we must love each other. and protect each other. we have nothing to lose. thank you. >> [applause] >> he is the liberation seeker. he is the people's preacher. he is the founding president of the national action network and he is the one who called us to be here today to send a message for those that would come tomorrow. let us receive, at this time, the president and founder of the national action network, the man called for this day, reverend dr. al sharpton. >> no justice -- >> no peace. >> no justice -- >> no peace. >> what do we want? >> justice. >> when do we want it? >> now. >> when do we want it? >> now. >> we won't go back. we won't -- >> go back. >> we won't -- >> go back. >> we won't -- >> go back. >> all right. we are gathered here and we march in the driving rain because we want this nation to understand that what has been fought for and gained, that you are going to be more than one election to turn it around. we have called this march on four nonnegotiable issues. voting rights, criminal justice and police reform, equal and fair economic justice, and the affordable care act. we come to washington from all over this country. they are going to live tomorrow and say there wasn't but to hundred of us but look at this crowd in the rain. we come not to appeal to donald trump, because he has made it clear what his policies are and what his nominations are. we come to say to the democrats in the senate and in the house and into the moderate republicans to get some backbone. get some guts. we didn't send you down here to be weak need. -- to be weak-kneed and to make friends. we sent you down here to stand up for senior citizens, to stand up for students that can't pay their loans. stand up for victims of police abuse. if you can't do the job then we will come here and bring you back home. we are not going to compromise on those four things. what we must do, as there is action all over the country, and as we see the votes on confirmation, i am taking a list today of you that are ready. we are going to go to the senators offices and we are going to visit them right before the vote for mr. sessions. we need to make some housecalls. we need to stay a little while. we need to stay in their office while they are on the floor voting yes, because dr. king died fighting for these rights. that is why we came to the king memorial. mrs. karen a scott king, who used to speak at national action network every year wrote a letter saying that sessions should not be on the federal bench. we owe it to her to have a rollcall on those that would put him in the justice department. you are not getting a pass. we want the world to see, if you sell us out we are going to let everybody know who you are. when we look at the fact that in the confirmation hearing no one raised while he was sitting there when he said he supported voter id. if you support voter id, why did you allow 77 motor vehicle places in alabama where they could get their id? they closed them right after the supreme court decision. eight of the 10 top black counties closed them. you didn't say anything about it, senator. you cannot be the head of the justice department and protect voters when you advocate suppressing the vote. you said that you were against federal intervention and federal people getting involved in local cases. where this week alone, we saw a consent decree in baltimore, a report in chicago, all of that he would stop. we are not here because we didn't have something else to do. we are not here because we fought hard -- we are here because we fought hard because we want to make sure that this administration put off crime and we are not going away now. criminal justice and police reform must go forward. let me say this. i saw on the front page of the washington post this morning, about the case of eric garner. i thought about how in this justice department is the case of walter scott, shot in the back on video whereas the federal case -- all of this movement, the re-enlivening of this, the revival of this started when a young boy with nothing but skittles and an iced tea in his hand was going home to his daddy and he was shot down and there wasn't even -- they wouldn't even arrest the felon. some of us went to sanford and stood up for trayvon martin. we are going to stand up for eric garner and we are going to stand up for walter scott and we are going to stand up for tamir rice. you may switch presidents but we are just going to switch legs and keep on watching. we won't back down. we won't be trumped. we won't be trumped. we won't be trumped. >> we won't be trumped. we won't be trumped. we won't be trumped. we won't be trumped. >> i want you to join me in welcoming to the stage the courageous face of these movements, the mother of trayvon martin, the mother of eric garner, and the brother walter scott. they came and marched today. we will not be moved. >> [applause] >> let's hear. the media like to put out their friends and say this person speaks for the movement. we work with the families that have suffered. we have been with sabrina from the beginning. we have been with eric garner. we still are. we have been with walter scott and we are going to be there to the end. where's gary white? one of the young men that donald trump said he should be executed . we march for him. we stood for him. he went to jail for something he didn't do and was finally exonerated after years in jail. he couldn't get a job so we gave him a job at national action network. we are still here. one of the central park five. we know how to fight trumped. that is an example of how we are going to fight. a man shot and killed with a question of mentality in san diego, california. alonso, his father joins us. richard alonso. these are the cases that we want the senate to make sure they have backbone to deal with. i want to hear from the families that we are going to hear from. we are going to hear from members of the senate, a couple have come with us. today, they are my colleagues in civil rights leadership. they are here so we don't want you to think that you came all this distance for a parade. lots of people have parades and call it a march. we lay out what we are going to do. how many of you are ready to make housecalls? how many of you are ready for the day to go in and have a session on sessions at your senator's office? >> we want to break it down state-by-state, call it sessions for sessions. then, we'll start, calling a summit since the public sector has been closing on us. we need to select in the private sector the companies that are violating our principles and we are going to have a national withdrawal of our dollars and we will make sure the private sector balances out the public sector so that if you are going to cut us off in washington, we are going to cut you off at home. mother of trayvon martin, sabrina. >> [applause] >> i want to say that i stand with rev. because he stood with me. we shall not be moved. although it was my son that was shot and killed back in february, 26, 2012, i want you to have the same compassion for me as if it was your child. it is very important that we look out for our young people. because they can't defend themselves. and so i continue this fight because my son was shot down and it made me stand up. so won't you stand with us? won't you go back to your communities and stand up and make a difference in your community? thank you and god bless you. >> [applause] >> the mother of eric garner miss gwen carr. >> thank you all for being here. we all need to be here. this is the first step. this is not the end. this is the beginning. when we leave here, we have work to do. like at national action network, i thank them so very much for standing with us. they stand with us when the lights are on and when they go out. a lot of you, when you go back to your homes it will be like nothing happened. we can't do that. we have to stand. there are things that are at stake that we have to address. our voting rights. we must not embarrass our forefathers by letting them take away our voting rights. that is the most powerful weapon that we have. and we will not stand by quietly while they manipulate the voting rights. our forefathers died. our forefathers blood is on that bill. we must uphold them. and our civil rights, the right to a living wage, we should not have to work two or three jobs to get the basic for our family. everyone deserves a living wage. why do they think that we are any less, the 67 million getting less than the minimum we don't want they minimum wage, we want a living wage. and women are getting paid $.67 to every dollar that a man makes. why? we do the best work. we should get paid accordingly. and the police reform, we should remember we must demand a way and community is being policed if we half to have a better standing. we must demand that they respect human life better than they do. we must demand they commune these sentences for people with low crimes and they are keeping them in jail doing two and three lifetimes. for what? we have to stand together on this and obamacare. that was his pet project. we can not let that be abolished. we cannot stand here and say let them take it. no. we lost an election, we did not lose our minds. we are going to stand up and push back and we are going to tell our senators the minorities you stand with us if you want our vote. i think you so much. [applause] >> we also the video of walter scott, a man shot in his back. running away. the sunday after he was shot, i went to north charleston with reverend rivers and we had a prayer vigil at that spot. the man we had lead us in prayer two months later was one of the nine killed in his church in charleston. it is too much going on to play games with the justice department. in the justice department is the case of walter scott. this family just like the garner family has advocated nothing but asking for justice. they have not called for one word of hate. not one act of violence. the question mr. trump is not how we act. the question is how you are going to act about justice. how are you going to have the people sent of and make america great when you can see people mode down in a church in bible class and turn and forget the killer. that is what makes people great. trump is loud saying nothing, tweeting in the middle of the night does not make you great. great is when you can locate and the face and refuse to hate and become like the haters. i bring you the brother of walter scott, -- >> i'm the youngest brother of walter scott and my mother cannot be here. she wanted to be here but our health cause or not to be held. it is not over until it is over. we sat in the courtroom for seven weeks looking for justice. i don't know about you, but i'm tired of being peaceful. i'm tired of justice not being served to all mankind. we are going to have to do it again. we have a trial again in march and we would like for your support to be there for me and my family. we want justice and we are going to stand together. it is not over until god says it is over. thank you again the scott family. >> let us hear from richard a longo, the father of -- >> are you guys awake? are you all awake? -- when my son was shot in san diego by richard gonzales, a war has been declared on humanity. a line has been drawn that when we are fighting -- it is called but we have to move forward. my son was killed because of his black skin. he should not have been shot. he was aiming to kill. we don't have military eyes to police. i'm sorry. i get very annoyed when i remember my son was killed. he was looking for protection and safety. when i brought my son to america to look for justice, the country where i came from to look for justice is where my son was killed. it is a big contradiction. i do not understand it. we have to fight and we must be ready to fight. join us to fight. we fight to win. arambe. >> arambe. >> arambe. >> arambe. thank you. one senator who has stood up to fight and has marched with us today, united states senator from organ, senator merkley. give him a hand. [applause] >> what do we want? >> justice. when do we want it? >> now. >> i know you are all ready to march in the cold. are you willing to march up to capitol hill? are you willing to talk to justice to power? are you willing to say to the powerful that we want the end of racial profiling? we want the end of mass incarceration? >> yes. we want quality health care for every american? >> yes. >> dr. martin luther king said there is a dark and desolate valley, but we must go to the sunlit path of justice. are you ready to go on that path? >> yes. what are the first three words of our constitution? we the people. it is not we the powerful. what is it? it is not we the privileged. it is we the people. so let us march onto capitol hill and go to every senate office and demanded that we want -- demand that we want that sunlit path of justice for every american. thurgood marshall on the supreme court, the first african-american to serve, he said that we must not say it is ok to have indifference. there is a better path, a better america. let us fight for that better america. i am proud to stand with you. thank you. [applause] >> senator merkley. give him a hand. [applause] >> as i bring on of my national civil rights leader colleagues, let me first bring in the mayor of newark, new jersey. mayor ross baraka. [applause] >> no justice. no justice. no justice. we are all the way from newark, new jersey. i know newark is in the house. all 300,000 with us and with reverend out sharpton and the national action network to say we will not be moved. we are here some 50 years later after dr. martin luther king jr. brought us down here to cash a check that was marked insufficient funds. we are still here 50 years later trying to cash that staying -- same check. we are still here trying to get what we deserve in this place and we're here to tell them that we shall not be moved. america is not great because of donald trump. america is great because millions of people fought to end slavery. america is only great because the mother of -- stood with her son's body after you was pulled from the river to show that we will discover and into segregation. america is great because we stop to show the world we would defeat jim crow. america is great because we worked to destroy slavery in the south. america is only great because we march the streets. we shed our blood and we did not sit down in the face of tyranny and oppression. america is great because the people have made it great. i am going to sit down, but i am not a part of the minority. i am part of the majority. the majority of americans want an increase in minimum wage. the majority of americans want criminal justice reform. the americans -- majority of americans want affordable health care. the majority of americans want free or affordable college. the majority of americans want criminal justice reform. and the majority of americans did not vote for donald trump. i stand with the majority and not the minority. i did not lose. i won. my god is not a loser. my god is a winner. i stand with those who won. victory to the oppressed. when we fight we win. when we fight we win.

[applause] >> i am glad to be here to join all of us as we come across the country to be a part of an important statement of a rejection of what appears to be policies that are designed to
